Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following lines with your actual API keys:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<Your_Google_API_Key>
PINECONE_API_KEY=<Your_Pinecone_API_Key>
```

Replace `<Your_Google_API_Key>` and `<Your_Pinecone_API_Key>` with the respective API keys you have.
