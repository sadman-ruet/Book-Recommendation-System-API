## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Create a `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following lines with your actual API keys:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<Your_Google_API_Key>
PINECONE_API_KEY=<Your_Pinecone_API_Key>
```

Replace `<Your_Google_API_Key>` and `<Your_Pinecone_API_Key>` with the respective API keys you have.

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Make sure you have all the required libraries installed. You can install them using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Run the API Server**

To start the API server, use **Uvicorn** (an ASGI server for FastAPI) by running this command from the root directory:

```bash

```

This will start the server in development mode with automatic reloads.
